# Abstract
This paper applies several machine learning algorithms to enhance DMA decisions by electricity utilities. These methods are implemented on a data set of categorical features describing the board state between a king and a rook/a king and a pawn and if it was winnable or not. In the end catboost was the best model for predicting winnability due to being designed for categorical features.
